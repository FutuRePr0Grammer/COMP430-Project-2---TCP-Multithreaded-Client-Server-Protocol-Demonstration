# COMP430-Project-2---TCP-Multithreaded-Client-Server-Protocol-Demonstration

To Run this, open the command line, and start the PhoneServer (i.e. java PhoneServer.java). Then open a new command line, and start PhoneClient.java. If you wish, you can start multiple clients as this is multithreaded. The commands are as follows:

STORE Name Number
GET Name
REMOVE Name
END

As of right now, sometimes a "300 Bad Request Message" will pop up after a GET, even when correct. Hit ENTER until the desired name's number appears. If any other messages appear, as with GET, keep hitting ENTER. It is storing \n characters or sommething like that, and I am unsure of how to fix it.
